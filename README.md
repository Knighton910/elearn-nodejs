:sparkles:Elearn  


teacher & students alike can sign up for classes. Instructors can sign up to teach a class & view the details of that class.
And students can sign up for a class after viewing the name of it & who teaching it.

This is a medium sized app running on mongoDB, mongoose & express along with passport for validity, and as well using handlebarsJS templates

Start App -
 ```bash
$ npm start
```
```js
 running @ localhost:3000
 ```

[note to self: bug hunting]
so, I think I have most of the logic/code in place for this app to run as expected. Now what i need to do is, set up the views for Teacher assistants & I really think we are near the end of this app. But for the future I'd like to scale it up even more then deploy it on AWS web services. Now speaking of such things, i think i would like to do this next weekend on saturday :)
